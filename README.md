## 🐾 Welcome! 

Great to see you here. Thank you for having a look at at the repo for **PurrfectMatch**. 

## 🐈‍⬛ About the project

As cat (and animal) lovers, we know how important is to find your purrfect cat and for the cat to find their dream owner(s).

So we decided to create web app for use by pet shelters to match with potent potential owners. That's how **PurrfectMatch** came to life! 

The purpose of this app is: 
* To simplify the process of accurately matching pets with potential owners based on the pet’s requirements and the owner’s lifestyle. 

Ideally this would:
 - reduce the likelihood of pets going home with incompatible owners and/or returning of pets to shelters.
- increase human confidence in their pet choice leading to higher adoption rates
- decrease staff/volunteer time needed in the matching process
